# Defaults-prediction-Portfolio-Optimization
Machine learning techniques to determine bank defaults and optimal composition of portfolio weights

## Task 1
### Introduction
This task focuses on constructing a predictive model capable of determining the likelihood of bank defaults. Given the complexities of financial datasets and the critical nature of accurate default predictions, the study explores a variety of methodological approaches. By employing and comparing different machine learning techniques the goal is to identify the method that provides the highest accuracy in predicting defaults.

## Task 2
### Introduction
This task examines the daily returns of 48 industry portfolios, ranging across diverse sectors. The objective is to determine the optimal portfolio composition across different time windows, analyzing how portfolio variance is influenced by the choice of weighting scheme and the implications for portfolio performance.
